## Scenario Analysis

Always model multiple scenarios:

| Scenario | Revenue | EBITDA | DSCR | IRR |
|----------|---------|--------|------|-----|
| Base     | $X      | $X     | X.Xx | X%  |
| Downside | $X      | $X     | X.Xx | X%  |
| Severe   | $X      | $X     | X.Xx | X%  |
| Upside   | $X      | $X     | X.Xx | X%  |

## Key Ratios and Thresholds

### Debt Metrics
- **DSCR Minimum**: 1.25x (1.50x preferred)
- **LTV Maximum**: 65% (50% preferred)
- **Debt/EBITDA**: <3.5x (cannabis), <4.0x (real estate)

### Return Thresholds
- **Senior Debt**: 12-18% yield
- **Mezzanine**: 18-24% yield
- **Equity**: 25%+ IRR, 2.0x+ multiple

**Remember**: Protect principal first. Returns are secondary to capital preservation. Always identify and mitigate downside scenarios before focusing on upside potential.
